# Uniswap SDK + Ethers.js Example

A working example of how to use Uniswapâ€™s SDK and Ethers.js to swap DAI for WETH on Goerli testnet.

## Getting Started

I have supplied an API provider and a Goerli test account with 0.5 ETH and 50 DAI in it. Unless someone decides to drain the test account, all you need to do is:

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start`

If the test account has been drained, see my [blog post](https://jeremysik.substack.com/p/uniswap-sdk-ethersjs-example) for tips on how to get another one.
